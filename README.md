# Do not Lose Attention

A Microsoft Edge extension to block websites that make you lose focus.

_NOTE: This extension is entirely developed by GPT-4. I have not written or modified a single line of code for this problem. I acted as a prompt engineer and followed the instructions ChatGPT was giving me._
